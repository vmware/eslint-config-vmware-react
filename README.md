# eslint-config-vmware-react

VMware's ESLint config based on eslint-config-react-app.

## Overview

Inspired by [`eslint-config-airbnb-typescript-prettier`](https://github.com/toshi-toma/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript-prettier) but based on [`eslint-config-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app).

Mostly uses "WARN" level to allow a better DX with eslint-loader.
Code is transpiled when warnings are present but not when errors exists.

In CI treat warnings as errors with ESLint option: `--max-warnings 0`.

# How to use

Install `eslint`, `typescript` with `@vmw/eslint-config-vmware-react`.

```bash
$ npm install eslint typescript eslint-config-vmware-react --save-dev
```

and put into your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: '@vmw/vmware-react',
};
```
